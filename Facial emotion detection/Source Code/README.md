# using tensorflow,keras and openCV.

# tensorflow -> Graph-Based Computation also mathematical ops
# Keras -> highly-productive interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems with Tensor Flow
# Open CV -> image processing and computer vision tasks -> detection, face recognition, and tracking.

# H5 -> Hierarchical Data Format -> Supports Large Complex Data's
# XML -> Machine readable and Human readable format
